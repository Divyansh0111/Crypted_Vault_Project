# Crypted_Vault_Project
Crypted IPFS Vault using MERN Stack and Blockchain

Overview

This project implements a crypted IPFS vault using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack along with blockchain technology. The vault allows users to securely store files on the IPFS network while encrypting the data and managing access through blockchain-based and JWT authentication.

Features

User authentication using blockchain technology for enhanced security.
Upload encrypted files to the IPFS network and store their encrypted hashes on the blockchain.
View and manage uploaded files within the web interface.
User-friendly interface built with React.js for seamless interaction.

Technologies Used

MongoDB: Database to store user data and encryption key.
Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js, used to handle server-side logic.
React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for the front-end.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment used to run the server-side code.
IPFS (InterPlanetary File System): Peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing files, used for storing encrypted files.
Blockchain: Used for authentication and storing file metadata securely.
